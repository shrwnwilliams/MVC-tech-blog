# MVC-tech-blog

# Description
This is the final version of my tech blog. Users can create new accounts, make posts, see other users posts, and delete their own posts. If they close the browser and return later, they will still be logged in, and should they be logged out or choose to log out, they can log back in and their content will still be there. At the current time, there is neither commenting or post editing available.

# Deployed Site
Here is the link to the deployed site.
